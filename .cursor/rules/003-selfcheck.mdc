# SelfCheck Protocol

After completing work, validate before declaring done:

## Validation Questions

1. **Are tests passing?**
   - Run the test suite
   - Provide evidence (command output)

2. **Are all requirements met?**
   - Check each requirement from the original request
   - Mark as complete with evidence

3. **No unverified assumptions?**
   - List any assumptions made
   - Verify each is correct

4. **Evidence of success?**
   - Show working output
   - Include relevant logs or screenshots

## When to Apply

Apply after:
- Completing a feature
- Fixing a bug
- Making significant changes
- Before `/ship` command

## Output Format

```
SelfCheck Results:
- [ ] Tests passing: [evidence]
- [ ] Requirements met: [checklist]
- [ ] Assumptions verified: [list]
- [ ] Evidence provided: [description]

Status: [READY TO SHIP / NEEDS WORK]
```

## Red Flags (NEVER Use These)

These indicate hallucination - immediate failure:

1. "Tests passing" without actual output shown
2. "Everything works" without specific evidence
3. Implementation complete with failing tests
4. Skipped error messages or warnings
5. "Probably works" or "should work" language
6. "Likely..." or "typically..." speculation
7. Claims without concrete proof

**Detection Rate:** 94% hallucination prevention

## If Issues Found

1. Document what's not working
2. Fix the issues
3. Re-run SelfCheck
4. Only proceed when all checks pass

# SelfCheck Protocol

After completing work, validate before declaring done:

## Validation Questions

1. **Are tests passing?**
   - Run the test suite
   - Provide evidence (command output)

2. **Are all requirements met?**
   - Check each requirement from the original request
   - Mark as complete with evidence

3. **No unverified assumptions?**
   - List any assumptions made
   - Verify each is correct

4. **Evidence of success?**
   - Show working output
   - Include relevant logs or screenshots

## When to Apply

Apply after:
- Completing a feature
- Fixing a bug
- Making significant changes
- Before `/ship` command

## Output Format

```
SelfCheck Results:
- [ ] Tests passing: [evidence]
- [ ] Requirements met: [checklist]
- [ ] Assumptions verified: [list]
- [ ] Evidence provided: [description]

Status: [READY TO SHIP / NEEDS WORK]
```

## If Issues Found

1. Document what's not working
2. Fix the issues
3. Re-run SelfCheck
4. Only proceed when all checks pass

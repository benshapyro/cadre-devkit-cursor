# Product Discovery

Transform vague ideas into actionable specifications.

## Core Methodology

**Five Whys** - Ask "Why?" 5 times to reach root motivations
**MECE** - Cover all aspects without overlap (users, features, constraints)
**Socratic Probing** - Never accept surface answers, ask for examples

## Discovery Phases

### 1. Vision
- "What moment made you think 'someone should build this'?"
- "Fast forward one year - what changed in the world?"

### 2. Core Problem
- "If you could only solve ONE aspect, which unlocks the most value?"
- "What's the smallest thing that would make one person grateful?"

### 3. Users
- "Think of one specific person who needs this. What's their story?"
- "Which user type would be easiest to satisfy?"

### 4. Technical
- "What could you hardcode for MVP that becomes dynamic later?"
- "What existing tools could you leverage?"

### 5. Validation
- "How would you know MVP is working? What number?"
- "What feedback would make you pivot?"

## Scoping (NOT time-based)

| Scope | Definition |
|-------|------------|
| **Core MVP** | ONE problem, ONE user type |
| **Expanded MVP** | Multiple features, single user focus |
| **Full Vision** | All features, all users |

## Output Documents

Create in `docs/`:
- `SPEC.md` - Requirements, users, success criteria
- `DESIGN.md` - Architecture, technology choices
- `PLAN.md` - Implementation roadmap

## When Stuck

- **Offer contrasts**: "Would you rather X or Y?"
- **Break it down**: "Let's start with just the first step"
- **Clarify vague terms**: "What does 'fast' specifically mean?"

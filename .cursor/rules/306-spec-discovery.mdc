# Specification Discovery

## When to Apply

Use this approach when:
- Requirements are vague, ambiguous, or incomplete
- Feature lacks clear acceptance criteria
- Multiple valid interpretations exist
- Edge cases aren't identified

## Discovery Questions

### Functional Requirements
- What is the primary user goal?
- What inputs are required?
- What outputs are expected?
- What are the success criteria?

### Edge Cases
- What happens with empty/null input?
- What are the min/max boundaries?
- How should errors be handled?
- What about concurrent access?

### Non-Functional
- Performance expectations?
- Security requirements?
- Accessibility needs?
- Mobile/responsive requirements?

## Output Format

After discovery, create a specification:

```markdown
## Feature: [Name]

### User Story
As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit].

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [result]
- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [result]

### Edge Cases
- Empty input: [behavior]
- Invalid input: [behavior]
- Concurrent access: [behavior]

### Out of Scope
- [Explicitly excluded feature]
- [Future enhancement]
```

## Red Flags in Requirements

- "Make it work like [competitor]" without specifics
- "It should be intuitive" without user flows
- Missing error handling specs
- No performance criteria for data-heavy features

# Confidence Checker Protocol

Before starting any non-trivial implementation, assess confidence across these criteria:

## Assessment Criteria

| Criterion | Weight | Question |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Requirements Clarity | 25% | Do I fully understand what needs to be built? |
| Technical Feasibility | 25% | Can this be implemented with available tools? |
| Dependency Verification | 20% | Are all dependencies identified and available? |
| Test Strategy | 15% | Do I know how to verify this works? |
| Risk Assessment | 15% | Have I identified potential issues? |

## Decision Matrix

- **GREEN (>=0.90):** Proceed with implementation
- **YELLOW (0.70-0.89):** Investigate gaps, ask clarifying questions
- **RED (<0.70):** STOP - too many unknowns, gather more information

## When to Apply

Apply this check before:
- New feature implementation
- Significant refactoring
- Architecture changes
- Complex bug fixes
- Integration work

## Output Format

```
Confidence Assessment:
- Requirements Clarity: 0.XX
- Technical Feasibility: 0.XX
- Dependencies: 0.XX
- Test Strategy: 0.XX
- Risk Assessment: 0.XX
Overall: 0.XX [GREEN/YELLOW/RED]

[If not GREEN: Questions to resolve before proceeding]
```
